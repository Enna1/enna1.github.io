Hi! This is my personal page — thoughts mostly about programming.

Currently I am working as a compiler toolchain engineer at ByteDance.

I am involved in a wide range of things:
 - Responsible for compiler instrumentation based dynamic program analysis tools, such as AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer.\
   Deploy them for analyzing our data center software.\
   Found, analyzed and fixed a countless number of memory errors and data races in server-side software.
 - Heavily involved in switching to Clang/LLVM toolchain from GCC, keeping data center software with up-to-date Clang/LLVM toolchain.
 - Also track and improve compilation time for our server-side software.

I am knowledgeable of LLVM middle-end optimizations and keep learning the LLVM optimizer.\
I have less experience with LLVM backend but would like to (and plan to) learn more about LLVM backend design and implementation.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:xumingjie.enna1@bytedance.com) directly with any questions.
